## Built With 🛠
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Canvas](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas?authuser=1) - The Canvas class holds the "draw" calls. To draw something, you need 4 basic components: A Bitmap to hold the pixels, a Canvas to host the draw calls (writing into the bitmap), a drawing primitive (e.g. Rect, Path, text, Bitmap), and a paint (to describe the colors and styles for the drawing).
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
